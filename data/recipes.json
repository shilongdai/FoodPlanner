Set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.\nPress one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1\/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.\nPlace sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.\nMake a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.\nFold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.\nRepeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.\nSlowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatalie T\n","rating":4.8,"cuisine_path":["Desserts","Pies","Apple Pie Recipes"],"nutrition":{"Total Fat":[19.0,"g"],"Saturated Fat":[9.0,"g"],"Cholesterol":[31.0,"mg"],"Sodium":[124.0,"mg"],"Total Carbohydrate":[52.0,"g"],"Dietary Fiber":[3.0,"g"],"Protein":[2.0,"g"],"Vitamin C":[5.0,"mg"],"Calcium":[23.0,"mg"],"Iron":[1.0,"mg"],"Potassium":[156.0,"mg"]},"auto_time":0.0},{"recipe_name":"Sarah's Homemade Applesauce","prep_time":10.0,"cook_time":15.0,"total_time":25.0,"servings":4,"ingredients":"4  apples - peeled, cored and chopped, \u00be cup water, \u00bc cup white sugar, \u00bd teaspoon ground cinnamon","directions":"Combine apples, water, sugar, and cinnamon in a saucepan; cover and cook over medium heat until apples are soft, about 15 to 20 minutes.\nAllow apple mixture to cool, then mash with a fork or potato masher until it is the consistency you like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by cookin'mama.\ncookin mama\n","rating":4.8,"cuisine_path":["Side Dish","Applesauce Recipes"],"nutrition":{"Total Fat":[0.0,"g"],"Sodium":[3.0,"mg"],"Total Carbohydrate":[32.0,"g"],"Dietary Fiber":[4.0,"g"],"Total Sugars":[27.0,"g"],"Protein":[0.0,"g"],"Vitamin C":[6.0,"mg"],"Calcium":[13.0,"mg"],"Iron":[0.0,"mg"],"Potassium":[150.0,"mg"]},"auto_time":0.0},{"recipe_name":"Apple Crisp","prep_time":30.0,"cook_time":45.0,"total_time":75.0,"servings":12,"ingredients":"10 cups all-purpose apples, peeled, cored and sliced, 1 cup white sugar, 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, \u00bd cup water, 1 cup quick-cooking oats, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup packed brown sugar, \u00bc teaspoon baking powder, \u00bc teaspoon baking soda, \u00bd cup butter, melted","directions":"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\nPlace sliced apples in a 9x13-inch baking dish.

Pack the apple butter into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1\/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.\nPlace a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process 5 to 10 minutes.\nRemove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area.","rating":4.9,"cuisine_path":["Side Dish","Sauces and Condiments","Canning and Preserving Recipes","Fruit Butter Recipes"],"nutrition":{"Total Fat":[0.0,"g"],"Sodium":[2.0,"mg"],"Total Carbohydrate":[20.0,"g"],"Dietary Fiber":[2.0,"g"],"Total Sugars":[16.0,"g"],"Protein":[0.0,"g"],"Vitamin C":[5.0,"mg"],"Calcium":[8.0,"mg"],"Iron":[0.0,"mg"],"Potassium":[127.0,"mg"]},"auto_time":5.0},{"recipe_name":"Easy Apple Cinnamon Muffins","prep_time":20.0,"cook_time":25.0,"total_time":45.0,"servings":6,"ingredients":"1 \u00bd cups all-purpose flour, \u00be cup white sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, \u00bd teaspoon salt, 1  egg, \u2153 cup vegetable oil, \u2153 cup milk, 2  apples - peeled, cored and chopped","directions":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Add 3 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved. Break roasted noodles into thirds and add to the boiling water with the rice. Stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over. Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly. Cook until the first rice grain pops up to the surface. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface, until the timer goes off. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more.\nDrain rice and noodles in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch. Taste and gently rinse again if too salty. Set aside to drain completely. Wash and dry the pot.\nPlace the clean pot over medium heat. Add oil, 1 tablespoon saffron water, and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with the oil mixture. Tightly overlap potato slices in a single layer covering the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer.\nGently scatter rice-noodle mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure potatoes are completely covered and moving noodles away from the sides of the pot. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into the rice and noodles a few times, being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine 1\/4 cup boiling water with 2 tablespoons melted butter and remaining saffron water. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface.\nTest the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. When the pot sizzles, remove it from the heat. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot. Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source. Drizzle the butter mixture over the rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid.\nPlace a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove. Cook until crispy, rotating the pot a few times, about 35 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes so tahdig will release easily.\nMeanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat. Add dates, raisins, and cinnamon; sprinkle with a little salt. Cook and stir until dates are glistening and soft, 3 to 5 minutes.\nGently scatter rice on a platter and remove potato tahdig pieces and serve on the side. Sprinkle raisin-date sauce over top.","rating":5.0,"cuisine_path":["Side Dish","Rice Side Dish Recipes"],"nutrition":{"Total Fat":[12.0,"g"],"Saturated Fat":[4.0,"g"],"Cholesterol":[15.0,"mg"],"Sodium":[2124.0,"mg"],"Total Carbohydrate":[45.0,"g"],"Dietary Fiber":[2.0,"g"],"Total Sugars":[16.0,"g"],"Protein":[4.0,"g"],"Vitamin C":[0.0,"mg"],"Calcium":[15.0,"mg"],"Iron":[0.0,"mg"],"Potassium":[176.0,"mg"]},"auto_time":110.0},{"recipe_name":"Paleo Almond Date Cookies","prep_time":25.0,"cook_time":15.0,"total_time":50.0,"servings":24,"ingredients":"2 \u00bd cups blanched almond flour, 1 cup pitted and chopped dates, \u00bd cup chopped dried cherries, \u00bd cup chopped walnuts, 2 tablespoons chia seeds, or more to taste, \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, \u00bd teaspoon sea salt, \u00bd cup coconut oil, 1  egg, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 tablespoon vanilla extract","directions":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
